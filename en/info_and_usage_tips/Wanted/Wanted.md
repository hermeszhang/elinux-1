# Wanted



This article lists pages that are requested to be added to this wiki.
The page specifically lists pages that have been requested by users.
(Another way to do this is to create a stub page for the desired page,
and add the tag for Category:NeedsEditing.) However, this page lists
pages that people would like to see, but have insufficient knowledge or
expertise to create.

An automatically generated list of pages that are referenced, but do not
exist, is at
[Special:Wantedpages](http://eLinux.org/Special:WantedPages "Special:WantedPages")

## User-requested pages

Put your request for a page or article you would like to see on this
wiki in the list below:

 Realtime testing best practices 
I'd like to see a document collecting existing information about
realtime testing, with links to test programs and information about
already-performed tests (with pros and cons for each approach).
[TimBird](http://eLinux.org/index.php?title=User:TimBird&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:TimBird (page does not exist)")

comparison of different C libraries

Kernel debugging processors from user space ( kgdb and other tools )
[Dinesh](http://eLinux.org/index.php?title=User:Dinesh&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Dinesh (page does not exist)")

 How to select a kernel version 
What are the steps to take or the factors to consider when picking a
kernel version? Given a CPU family, to what extent has support been
added to the mainline sources on kernel.org, or must a more
architecture-specific source be used? Pointers to high-level feature or
driver support (like the release summaries on kernelnewbies.org) might
be useful too.
