**NEWS:**

-   6th May 2014: [100,000+ cores
    shipped!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adapteva/parallella-a-supercomputer-for-everyone/posts/834748).

## About

The Parallella project was inspired by hardware communities such as
Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard and Arduino, and aims to democratise access to
parallel computing through providing an affordable open hardware
platform and open source tools, and supporting learning and the
development of software which is able to harness the power of parallel
systems.

### Motivation

Making parallel computing easy to use has been described as being *a
problem as hard as any that computer science has faced*. With such a big
challenge ahead we need to make sure as many people as possible have
access to open parallel hardware and development tools.

### Principles

The Parallella platform is being built on the following principles:

-   Open Access: all architecture and SDK documents openly published on
    the Web — no NDAs or special access required.
-   Open Source: software platform based on free and open source
    software (F/OSS) development tools and libraries. Board design files
    provided under an open source hardware license once the Parallella
    computer ships.
-   Affordable: the goal is to bring the hardware cost to below \$100,
    making it an affordable platform for all.
