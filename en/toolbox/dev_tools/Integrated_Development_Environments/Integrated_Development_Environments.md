# Integrated Development Environments



-   [Eclipse](http://eLinux.org/Eclipse "Eclipse") - Powerful IDE written in JAVA.
-   [Free Pascal](http://eLinux.org/Free_Pascal "Free Pascal") supports both a text-mode
    IDE and Lazarus (see below)
-   [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org) - Editor written in JAVA which can be
    expanded to a full IDE with plug-ins.
-   [KDevelop](http://www.kdevelop.org) - Standard IDE for KDE.
-   [Lazarus](http://eLinux.org/Lazarus "Lazarus"), a cross-platform IDE for Free Pascal,
    a 32bit / 64bit professional ObjectPascal compiler.
-   [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) - Powerful IDE,
    extensible in LISP, ships with modes to integrates with SCM (GIT,
    SVN, CVS...), build systems, debugger and even fancy multi-window
    with [ECB](http://ecb.sourceforge.net/).
-   [VIm](http://www.vim.org/) - Powerful IDE, extensible with
    scripting, can use various modules for completion and more.
-   [KScope](http://kscope.sourceforge.net/) - Cscope based source
    editing environment with KDE.

-   [QtCreator](http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools/) is an
    nice IDE which has code completion, remote deployment (with version
    2.3) and Outline view. It also has an VIm mode. Its menus are much
    cleaner than these from Eclipse and its easier to get started with
    this ide than Eclipse for that very reason.
