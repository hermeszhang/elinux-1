# Help:About



This is the embedded Linux wiki.

The purpose of this wiki is to preserve and present information about
using Linux in embedded systems. The primary target audience is
developers, engineers, managers, hobbyists and others who are involved
with putting Linux into embedded systems.

Please utilize this information in your own development efforts, and
please provide back information when you can. See [Volunteer editor
tasks](http://eLinux.org/Volunteer_editor_tasks "Volunteer editor tasks") to get started,
if you don't know where to begin.

## Sponsors

This site is sponsored by the Linux Foundation, with OSUOSL providing
Hosting. [Bill Traynor](http://eLinux.org/User:Wmat "User:Wmat") is the primary
administrator and maintainer of this site.

## History

This site was created in late 2006 and early 2007, and opened to the
public in June 2007. The major initial content for this site came from
merging content from two previous sites:

-   the original elinux.org site
-   the CELF public wiki

The original elinux.org site had a lot of content about putting Linux
onto existing products (often, products which were not shipped with
Linux or designed to support it).

The CELF public wiki has a collection of resources, including research
results, collections of links to interesting articles, and many
presentations from CELF and other conferences.

In 2006, it was decided to create a larger site with a combination of
the two sets of resources. CELF hired a part-time administrator to work
on this, and Movial provided hosting for the site.

Originally the site was hosted by Movial

In 2008, the site was moved to a virtual host, hosted by GoDaddy.com.

Some concepts for the site came out a CELF AG meeting in 2006. Notes
from that meeting are at [Embedded Wiki
Design](http://eLinux.org/Embedded_Wiki_Design "Embedded Wiki Design"). A task force was
formed, which held a conference call, with notes at:
