# Podcasts



-   [[1]](http://tllts.org) - The (Original) Linux Link Tech Show,
    weekly Linux podcast with archive going back to 2003.
-   [[2]](http://www.timesys.com/resources/podcast) - Timesys LinuxLink
    Radio. (Despite the name, it's has nothing to do with the older
    Linux Link podcast, and it's not on the radio. No longer updates on
    a regular schedule, but the archives are available.)
