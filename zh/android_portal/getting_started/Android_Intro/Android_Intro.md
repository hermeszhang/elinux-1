## Overview

Android is a software platform and operating system written by Google
and the Open Handset Alliance, designed for use in small form factor
devices and smartphones.

The [Android wikipedia
entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Android) is a really good
place to get an overview of Android capabilities, history and direction.
I won't duplicate the information from that site here.

The official web site for Android is
[http://www.android.com/](http://www.android.com/). From here you can
find links to:

-   [Android Market](http://www.android.com/market/) - This is the place
    where developers can post (for free or for sale) applications to run
    on Android-based devices, and where users can download these
    applications.
-   [Android Developer Site](http://developer.android.com/index.html) -
    Where software developers can learn how to write applications for
    Android devices, or modify aspects of the Android software itself.
-   [Android Open Source Project](http://source.android.com/) - This is
    where you can find the source code for the Android operating system
    (including Linux kernel, the libraries, Dalvik VM and rest of the
    Android system.)
-   [The Growth of Android in Embedded
    Systems](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/free-linux-training/download-training-materials/growth-of-android-in-embedded-systems)
    - This Linux Training publication has some excellent material on the
    current (as of early 2013) status of Android as it relates to
    traditional embedded linux.

Clicking on the "What is Android" tab takes you to:
[http://www.android.com/about/](http://www.android.com/about/), which
has some high-level bullet points, and a video with a little bit of
Android history.

## Videos

### Prototype Video

In November, 2007, Google released a video showing some of the features
of their early prototype work on Android. See
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FJHYqE0RDg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FJHYqE0RDg)

### G1 Product Video

The first phone product based on Android was the G1, manufactured by HTC
and shipped by T-Mobile.

The G1 home page is at:
[http://www.t-mobileg1.com/](http://www.t-mobileg1.com/). This site
contains many videos and voiceovers describing G1 and Android features.

## Technical Information

A good place to start, for technical information, is Google's ["What is
Android?"
page](http://developer.android.com/guide/basics/what-is-android.html%7C)

Another good place with technical information is [Android
FAQ](http://android-dls.com/wiki/index.php?title=Android_FAQ)

Also, go to [Android
Architecture](http://eLinux.org/Android_Architecture "Android Architecture") on this
site.
